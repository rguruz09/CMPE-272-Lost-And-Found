This is an android application for SJSU students based on crowd sourcing.
The user who has lost his belongings will report about his lost item by
signing up his account and he will also specify the last known location of
the item in the university. People who are in the vicinity of last known
location and who have this application installed will get to know about
the lost item. If anyone finds the items they will inform the owner about
it through messages which will be provided in the applications. Every few
minutes the application will send the geo location of the userâ€™s phone so
it keeps track of their location. Once a lost item is reported, the server
finds the other application users around that location and send the message
to them. People who find the items can reply to the message sent by the
item owner.

This app is developed on Ionic and Cordova framework. Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development. Ionic is built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps. It uses web technologies such as CSS, HTML5 and SASS.
